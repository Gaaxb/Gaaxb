# üí´ About Me :
üëã Hi, I'm Gaaxb !<br>This description is in English for the sake of GitHub, but I speak French as well.<br><br>üíª I've been passionate about computers for as long as I can remember, and I'm constantly on a quest for learning and exploring in the digital realm. While I may not be a world-class developer, I consider myself a curious and resourceful digital tinkerer.<br>üåê My playground includes web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where I manage to get by comfortably to create personal projects. However, my true fascination lies in setting up simple yet practical system configurations, whether it's for Games servers, domain names, or other online services.<br>üîí Cybersecurity is a field that particularly fascinates me. I'm always keeping an eye on the latest trends in computer security and enjoy exploring solutions to protect systems and data from digital threats.<br>üöÄ On this GitHub profile, you'll find a mix of my personal projects, ranging from small scripts to more ambitious endeavors. My goal here is to share my discoveries, learn more, and perhaps collaborate on exciting projects.<br><br>Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss development, cybersecurity, or simply exchange ideas. I'm always open to new opportunities.<br>üì´ You can reach me via Contact@Gaaxb.me or on differents social media with my username : @Gaaxb<br><br>Looking forward to coding and learning together ! üöÄ<br>
